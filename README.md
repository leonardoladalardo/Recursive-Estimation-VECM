# Recursive-Estimation-VECM

Here you will find the material used to create a recursive estimation for a VECM model. The algorithm has been created using as basis the StatsModel package, from Seabold, Skipper, and Josef Perktold\footnote{“Statsmodels: Econometric and statistical modeling with python.” Proceedings of the 9th Python in Science Conference. 2010.}.
