# Recursive-Estimation-VECM

Here you will find the material used to create a recursive estimation for a VECM model. The algorithm has been created using as basis the StatsModel package, from Seabold, Skipper, and Josef Perktold (2010). The only purpose of this notebooks is to ilustrate a basic algorithm of recursive estimation, that could be easily adapted to other purposes.
